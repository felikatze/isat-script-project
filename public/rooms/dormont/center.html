<h1 id="daydream">Daydreaming One</h1>
<p>Many of Siffrin's reaction here change if you've found out where the Daydreaming One's sister went. For simplicity's sake, this will be labelled "After finding out".</p>
<p>There's also some alternate text for a switch that, as far as I can tell, cannot be activated. Since this text is unused, it has been omitted.</p>

<br>

<p>The way to get the key scene with the Daydreaming One is to ask about Isabeau and Odile in either order, then ask about Odile again.</p>
