                    ACT 4 can start with two different events. The first is the end of <a href="/acts/act3-4/kingquest.html">Kingquest</a>. The other is getting to the end with all <a href="/rooms/end/euphrasie.html#fq">Friendquests</a>.

                    Both need to be completed to enter ACT 4, it's just that whichever you do last increments the ACT counter. The scenes for each remain identical whether they are first or second.
