                    Note that any ordinal numbers consider visiting the Change God in ACT 1 to be the 0th time. So, the "first time" is actually the first time you interact with the statue <i>outside</i> of ACT 1, the "second time" is the second time you interact with the statue <i>outside</i> of ACT 1, and so on.
