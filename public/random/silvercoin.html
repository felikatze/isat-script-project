<h2 id="use">Usage</h2>
<p>WIP Note: add links</p>
<p>The usage text when using the Silver Coin is decided by RNG. The game rolls a number between 1 and 51. "The Incident" triggers at 61 or higher.</p>
<p>Since rolling a 61 naturally is impossible, several factors add to the rolled RNG.</p>
<p>In addition to making the Incident monologue possible to reach, the additions also make the lower RNG options less likely or even impossible to occur.</p>
<p>Of note: additions to the Silver Coin Help only occur the first time each condition is met.</p>

<br>
<p><b>Factors include:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Showing Loop the coin in ACT 2 & 3: +1 each</li>
  <li>Showing Loop the coin in ACT 4: +5</li>
  <li>Interact with the croissants in the Boulangerie in ACT 3 or 4: +3</li>
  <li>Interact with the croissants in the Boulangerie with Odile during her Friendquest: + 3</li>
  <li>Interact with the croissants in the locked Break Room on Floor 2: +1</li>
  <li>Interact with the open book in the room with the dog on Floor 3: +1</li>
  <li>Read the book on Wish Craft in the <a href="/rooms/floor2/secret_library.html">Secret Library</a>: +1</li>
  <li>Use the coin in ACT 3: +10 (does not stack with ACT 4 & book bonuses)</li>
  <li>Use the coin in ACT 4: +15 (does not stack with ACT 3 & book bonuses)</li>
  <li>Use the coin after reading the first book on Wish Craft in the locked Storage Room: +20 (does not stack with ACT 3 & 4 bonuses)</li>
</ul>
