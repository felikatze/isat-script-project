                <h2 id="use">Usage</h2>
                <p>The usage text when using the Silver Coin is decided by RNG. The game rolls a number between 1 and 51. "The Incident" triggers at 61 or higher.</p>
                <p>Since rolling a 61 naturally is impossible, several factors add to the rolled RNG.</p>
                <p>In addition to making the Incident monologue possible to reach, the additions also make the lower RNG options less likely or even impossible to occur. This also means viewing the Incident is not possible in ACT 2, as the amount of bonuses available does not amount to +10.</p>
                <p>Of note: additions to the Silver Coin Help only occur the first time each condition is met.</p>
