                <p><b>Source:</b> Common Event 126 (UnlockSkills)</p>
                <p>Post-battle text for specific level milestones. Only occurs when party members besides Siffrin learn new skills or hit max level.</p>

                <br>

                <p>If multiple party members hit a milestone at the same time (i.e. learn skills at the same time or al hit max level at the same time), then the text plays in the order of first Mirabelle, then Isabeau, then Odile.</p>

                <br>

                <p>Siffrin does not have any special text for any level milestone.</p>

                <p>If Mirabelle and one other character hit max level at the same time, Mirabelle's full text plays, then the other character's shortened text. Because Mirabelle's always plays first, she doesn't have shortened text.</p>
                <p>If Isabeau and Odile hit max level at the same time, Isabeau's full text plays first, then Odile's shortened text.</p>
                <p>Odile's full text only plays if she hits max level alone, without any other characters concurrently.</p>

                <br>

                <p>It's highly unlikely that Mirabelle will hit max level the same time as anyone else, since she needs ~40k more EXP than Isabeau and Odile.</p>
                <p>Isabeau and Odile require the exact same amount of EXP, and thus only level up out of sync if one of them was K.O. at the end of a battle.</p>

                <br>

                <p>Text only occurs the first time a given character reaches max level, alone or concurrently.</p>
