                                No one else calls you Sif, no one else calls him Isa. You don't know why, or maybe you do, now, but that's how it is.

                                The Researcher's name is Odile. That's what you call her, too. A very Vaugardian name, which always struck you as weird.
                            </p>

                            <p class="dialogue-line">

                                It makes sense, now, that she's half Vaugardian. Maybe she chose that name herself, maybe it was given to her.
                            </p>

                                And the Kid's name is Bonnie. Boniface, but no one except Odile calls them that.

                                They have trouble seeing this name as theirs, because they're still young. They introduced themselves as Bonnie as soon as they could talk.

                                You called them "Bonbon" for a while, because they always had snacks and sweets on them. But you stopped, after you started thinking they hated you.
