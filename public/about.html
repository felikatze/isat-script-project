                <h2 id="format">Site formatting</h2>
            
                <p>The formatting of script pages more or less follows certain rules.</p>
            
                <br>
                <h3>Basics</h3>
            
                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p class="dialogue-line">
                        <span class="dialogue-head">
                            <span class="dialogue-name">Loop</span>
                            <span class="dialogue-expression">(teehee2)</span>
                        </span>
                        This is test dialogue!
                    </p>
                </div>
            
                <br>
            
                <p>Chunks of dialogue (typically under larger headings) are all contained inside an outlined box, and displayed in the VCR OSD MONO font, which is the font used in ISAT. To change the font, press the Settings button on the bottom left (top right on mobile), and select either "Cascadia Mono" or "OpenDyslexic3" as desired. "Default Font" restores the default.</p>
            
                <br>
            
                <p>Character names are followed by the respective portrait name in parentheses. These are greyed out, <span class="dialogue-expression">(like this)</span> and can be toggled using the "Toggle Expressions" button on the bottom right.</p>
            
                <br>
                <p>A new line of dialogue starts whenever a new portrait is called by the game's script, even if that portrait is the same as the previous.</p>
            
                <br>
            
                <p>All instances of dialogue and monologue are separated by an empty line.</p>
            
            
                <br>
            
                <p>Notes that are not part of the game's script are displayed</p>
                <p class="dialogue-note">
                    Greyed out like this.
                </p>
            
                <hr>
            
                <h3>Variations on dialogue</h3>
                <p>When any text varies for any reason whatsoever, most commonly due to different acts, these variations are marked by a bold heading. The level of the heading varies on a case by case basis, though it is most commonly a heading level of 4.</p>
            
                <br>
            
                <p>If only a single line is varied, variations are shown through a list.</p>
            
                <br>
                <p>If multiple lines vary, variations are shown through headings and separate paragraphs.</p>
            
                <br>
            
                <p>Variations are separated by a horizontal line. If there was text with a heading specifying its condition, followed by a horizontal line, and the next block of text doesn't have a heading, then this is unconditional text.</p>
            
                <hr>
            
                <h3>Siffrin's dialogue portraits</h3>
                <p>Even if no dialogue variation occurs, it's still noted when Siffrin's dialogue portraits vary.</p>
                <p>This is always done through a list. This list includes the conditions of the specific portrait, as well as the internal thoughts attached to the specific textbox of the dialogue.</p>
            
                <br>
            
                <p>If Siffrin does not have any variations, their speech is not separated by an empty line and simply integrated into other dialogue.</p>
            
                <br>
            
                <p>All of Siffrin's dialogue is in quotation marks for stylistic consistency within the game.</p>
            
                <hr>
            
                <h3>Dialogue choices</h3>
            
                <p>When a branching dialogue choice occurs, all choices are presented in a clickable list. Clicking a dialogue option reveals all text attached to it.</p>
                <p>Common dialogue follows below the list.</p>
                <p>All dialogue options can be opened at once using the "Toggle choices" button. Note that this button actually reverses what's open and what's closed - if you've opened some and not others, it'll switch their states around.</p>
            
                <br>
                <p>Why don't you give it a shot?</p>
                <ul class="dialogue-option">
                    <li>

                <p><i>In Stars and Time</i> is an indie game developed by insertdisc5 and published by Armor Game Studios, about a little guy (gender-neutral) trapped in the torment nexus.</p>
            
                <br>
            
                <p>Everybody should <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1677310/In_Stars_And_Time/">play it immediately</a>.</p>
                <p>It's also available for Switch and Playstation. FYI.</p>
            
                <br>
            
                <h1>About the guy running the site</h1>
            
                <h2 id="meee">About me</h2>
                <p>Hi, hello! My name is Felix (though I mostly go by Feli online). My pronouns are he/him, I'm an adult, I cried four times when I played <abbr title="In Stars and Time">ISAT</abbr>, and I followed the game's development since the days of the START AGAIN comics.</p>
            
                <br>
            
                <p>I first found insertdisc5's tumblr account through their amazing Kingdom Hearts comics, and have been taken by their work since. It manages to be both simple yet so vividly expressive and emotionally reasonant. (RE: I cried four times (minimum) when I played <abbr title="In Stars and Time">ISAT</abbr>)</p>
            
                <br>
                <p>Once the game finally launched in November 2023, a mere eight days after my birthday (thank you, Adrienne), I descended upon it like a ravenous beast, and it has not left my mind since.</p>
            
                <br>
            
                <p>Congratulations, <abbr title="In Stars and Time">ISAT</abbr>. You finally dethroned the fixation I've had for a full year.</p>
            
                <br>
            
                <p>My only experience in coding prior to this whole shebang was a rudimentary knowledge that CSS and Html <i>exist</i> thanks to some time spent editing on fanwikis. Including the <abbr title="In Stars and Time">ISAT</abbr> wiki, who could've guessed?</p>
                <p>Hence, this page is rather rough around the edges, but I try my best. Many thanks again to my wonderful sibling Paskariu for many a VC spent staring at my spectacular coding endeavors.</p>
            
                <br> 
            
                <p>You could check out my socials, mayhaps?</p>

                <h2 id="intent">The Script Project's goals</h2>
            
                <p>Please understand first and foremost that I am deeply, deeply in love with this game. Taking it apart by the seams like this, trying to figure out how every minor mechanic ticks, is a labor of love.</p>
            
                <br>
            
                <p>This script is intended primarily as reference for people who have already played the game. It is in no way intended to replace the experience of actually playing <abbr title="In Stars and Time">ISAT</abbr>. I don't believe it ever could, actually.</p>
            
                <br>
            
                <p>The first inspiration for this was, ironically enough, me writing <abbr title="In Stars and Time">ISAT</abbr> fanfiction. (a <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/52611805">link</a>, for those curious.) I had to reference canon quotes and wanted to be as accurate as I can, what with exactly repeated dialogues being one of <abbr title="In Stars and Time">ISAT</abbr>'s Main Things.</p>
            
                <br>
            
                <p>The only way to do that was to either boot up the game myself and replay to that specific point (good luck doing that with unique, one time only scenes or chance based dialogues), or trying to pick the scene I need out youtube videos. Both involved transcribing the dialogue by hand again, and both were a bit of a mess.</p>
            
                <br>
            
                <p>So, when I serendipitously gained access to the game files, a thought began to form: "What if I... just wrote all of it down?"</p>
                <p>It wouldn't even be the first video game I've done this for, mind you. This is simply how I show my love.</p>
            
                <br>
            
                <p>And, as far as I can tell, this script is also only used by those already obsessed with <abbr title="In Stars and Time">ISAT</abbr>. (It has also been used by at least two fic authors besides myself.)</p>
            
                <br>
            
                <p>In short, yeah.</p>
