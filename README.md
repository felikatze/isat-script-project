# isat-script-project

Hi! Welcome to the isat script project, wherein I'm trying to make a full script of the video game [In Stars and Time](https://instarsandtime.com)!

This github repository serves to allow collaboration on the [neocities page]((https://isat-script-project.neocities.org)). It was set up with extensive help from [goldstargloww](https://github.com/goldstargloww). 

Changes made to the main branch will automatically reflect to the neocities page!

When creating or updating a page, please remember to:

- follow appropriate HTML formatting practises. Compare with other pages for reference. Please use the file 1template.html to base a page off of.
- credit yourself on the page, please! Just a short text of "This page was created by..." under the title heading. Be proud of what you did, I don't want to steal anyone's thunder.
- Update the Index (index.html) in the "New Events" section with a link to the appropriate page.
- Update the RSS feed (feed.xml) with a link and short blurb of the page.
- add the page to the respective overview page (/overview/) if it's not present there already. you can also add work in progress pages to the overview.

I (felikatze) reserve the right to veto any changes, because this site is my baby. Thank you!
